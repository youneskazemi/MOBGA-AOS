# MOBGA-AOS: Multi-Objective Binary Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Operator Selection

## Introduction
MOBGA-AOS is an implementation of the multi-objective binary genetic algorithm integrating an adaptive operator selection mechanism proposed in the paper "Adaptive Crossover Operator Based Multi-Objective Binary Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection in Classification". This project is designed to address feature selection challenges in classification tasks by effectively reducing feature dimensions while maintaining or improving classification accuracy.

## Features
- **Adaptive Operator Selection**: Dynamically selects the most effective crossover operator based on evolutionary performance, optimizing the genetic algorithm's efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Simultaneously optimizes for both the number of features and the classification accuracy, providing a balanced approach to feature selection.
- **Extensive Testing Across Datasets**: Validated on ten diverse datasets, demonstrating robustness and versatility in various application scenarios.
